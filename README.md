# Linear_disk_movement
The starting configuration of this puzzle is a row of L cells, with disks located on cells 0 through n - 1. The goal is to move the disks to the end of the row using a constrained set of actions. At each step, a disk can only be moved to an adjacent empty cell, or to an empty cell two spaces away, provided another disk is located on the intervening cell. Given these restrictions, it can be seen that in many cases, no movements will be possible for the majority of the disks. For example, from the starting position, the only two options are to move the last disk from cell n - 1 to cell n, or to move the second-to-last disk from cell n - 2 to cell n. Applying bfs searching and A*searching to solve this problem.
